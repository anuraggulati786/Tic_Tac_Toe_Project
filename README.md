# Tic_Tac_Toe [Human vs Computer]

Project Description : 
             1) In this we have a human and its opponent is computer itself.
              
             2) I have used Minimax Algorithm in Game Theory. [Minimax is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the                   optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally].
             
             3) In most of the cases either it's a draw or the computer will win.
